# README.txt

hi there! you've stumbled onto my desktop.
this folder is kind of a mirror of me: part portfolio, part scrapbook, part playground.

about me:
- I'm from Hong Kong
- I'm a sophmore at Yale (computing & the arts x data science)
- designer, storyteller, and consultant
- passionate about sustainability, creativity, and building things that connect people

things you'll find here:
- design projects & my photography
- little snapshots of my life (dogs, photos, doodles)
- experiments & side projects (apps, zines, etc.)

how to navigate:
open the folders, peek at files, click around.
when you're done, don't forget to sign the guestbook in the photobooth.

enjoy exploring
miffy
